# Project Cosmos

Space is a beautiful place that we can only hope to explore more in the future. Using the NASA API we can connect ourselves to astronomy. Users can select a date and year to get pictures from NASA to display the most strange and wonderful cosmic events. These pictures a picture come from thier powerful Telescopes and rovers.

## How It's Made:

This site was built using HTML, CSS, REST APIs, and Javascript. 
 
 I used some basic HTML to structe my site. I then used most of my time and focus on the CSS and JavaScript. I used 3 different CSS sheets to make sure I could help accebility and to help my code run smoother. I connected my files to the NASA databse using a fetch request in my JavaScript and used some DOM maniuplation to understand the functions better.

## Optimizations
To improve this project, I can make sure the user can switch from picture to video or video to picture. There were a few images that were videos from NASA.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to use NASA API to fetch images using correct syntax
and configuring of JavaScript functions for displaying and hiding elements. I also learned about how to make favicons for webpage to display across site and hugo file structure.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
